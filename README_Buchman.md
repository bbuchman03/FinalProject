# Read Me File For Final
By executing the R file "Final_Buchman.R" someone could replicate the results, as long as they have the proper files to go along with it. These files are located on Kaggle as part of a competition to predict March Madness results. The Kaggle competition page is called "March Macine Learning Mania 2021 - NCAAM", the data files from here need to be downloaded. When the files are downloaded, it will contain one folder, with two other folders located inside (as well as a zip file). Inside each folder is data, the files needed for this are
"MNCAATourneyCompactResults.csv"
"MRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv"
"MTeams.csv"
When these files are downloaded and into your proper working directory, then the script will run and the results will be duplicated as in the project.
